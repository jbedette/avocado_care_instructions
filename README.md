### DUVET

1. [Cover](https://www.avocadogreenmattress.com/products/organic-cotton-duvet-cover?_pos=1&_psq=organic+cotton+duve&_ss=e&_v=1.0)
    - CARE:

    **Machine-wash** your Organic Cotton Duvet Cover on a **gentle cycle** with similar colors in **cold water**. Use an eco-friendly detergent. Do not use fabric softeners, bleach, or whiteners. Line dry or tumble dry low and remove promptly. We do not recommend fabric softeners or dryer sheets, which reduce the absorbency of cotton. As a natural alternative, use wool dryer balls.

2. [Insert](https://www.avocadogreenmattress.com/products/best-luxury-down-duvet-insert?_pos=2&_psq=down+d&_ss=e&_v=1.0)
    - CARE:

    **Spot Clean Only.*** For small stains, spot cleaning with a mild detergent and water can be effective. Gently work on the stain and rinse the area thoroughly to remove any soap residue. Ensure the cleaned area is fully dry before using or storing the duvet. We suggest giving your duvet a good shake and fluffing it up about once a week or each time you change your sheets to ensure the down filling remains evenly distributed. The down is washed and cleaned with Allernon-21 Ultrafresh® technology (EPA registered & OEKO-TEX® listed) to help remove any allergens and keep the down smelling fresh and clean.

    - CARE:
    
    **Machine wash** your cotton cover in **cold water** with an eco-friendly laundry detergent. Lay flat or **hang to dry**. Do not use bleach. Allow to dry completely before putting the cover back on your pillow.

    - CARE:
    
    Please wash your Organic Waterproof Crib Protector before use with an eco-conscious laundry detergent. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low or hang on the line until completely dry. Getting the protector to the proper size may take up to three washes. We made them intentionally big since they are 100% cotton and will shrink.
